# Creating a Mobile Geolocation Backend in PHP with Windows Azure Web Sites #

---

<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

This demonstration shows how to create a PHP backend for a mobile application.  In this case, the website will run in Windows Azure Website and will expose endpoints for finding tagged geocoordinates within a specific radius as well as adding new geocoordinates.

Widows Azure Websites enables developers to quickly get up and running with websites.  Websites may be developed in ASP.NET, Node.js and PHP.  In addition, websites may use SQL or MySQL for data storage.  Deployment can be accomplished in several ways including TFS, FTP, and GIT.

### Create a New Web Site Hosted in Windows Azure ###

> **Speaking Point**
>
> During this demo we're going to create a Windows Azure Web Site.
>
> Lets start by opening the browser and accessing to the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. Open browser, go to the [Windows Azure Management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) and sign in using your **Microsoft Account** credentials associated with your subscription.

	> **Speaking Point**
	>
	> Thanks to the Quick Create option from the Windows Azure Management Portal, we can now get a Web Site working on the cloud just in seconds.

1. Click **New | Web Site | Create with Database** on the command bar.

### Preparing the MySQL Database ###

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Next, we're going to connect to our MySQL database and add a new table to it.
>
> Let's go to the dashboard panel of the Web Site we have just created.

1. Back to the Windows Azure Management Portal, click your Web Site name, under the **Name** column to access the Dashboard.

	![Accessing the Web Site Dashboard](Images/goToDashboard.png?raw=true "Accessing the Web Site Dashboard")

	_Accessing the Web Site Dashboard_

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Once we're at the dashboard, we'll go to the configure tab where we can see the configuration information for our database.

1. At the dashboard, click on the Configure tab near the top.

	![Accessing the configuration information](Images/clickOnConfigure.png?raw=true "Accessing the configuration information")

	_Accessing the Configuration information_

1. Scroll down until you get to connection strings.  Copy this information for later use.

	![Accessing database configuration details](Images/databaseConfigurationInfo.png?raw=true "Accessing database configuration")

	_Accessing database configuration_

1.  Open a terminal (or command prompt if using Windows).

1.  Navigate to a directory where you can access MySQL tools (i.e. /usr/local/mysql/bin on OSX).  

1.  Start MySQL (i.e. run ./mysql on OSX) with parameters --host, --username, and --password followed by the databasename.  For example:

	_./mysql --host=us-cdbr-azure-east-a.cloudapp.net --user=myuser --password=mypassword mydatabase_

1.  Execute the following query to create the table (this query can also be found in the sqlcreate.sql file in the source directory):

	````C#
CREATE TABLE geodata (
  Id char(36) NOT NULL,
  Type smallint(6) DEFAULT NULL,
  Description varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,
  Url varchar(400) DEFAULT NULL,
  Location point DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (Id)
);
````

1.  Ensure your table was created by running the following command and ensuring that the "geodata" table is present:
	`show tables;`

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Our database now has the table we're going to use for the rest of this demo.

### Creating a Cloud Storage Account ###

> ***Speaking Point***
>
>The mobile applications we're going to create to connect to this web site will be storing images and videos tied to geopoints.  To store those images and videos, we're going to create a Windows Azure Storage account.

1.  Return to the Windows Azure Portal.

1.  Go to New and select Storage.  Enter an available name (e.g. geostorage).

	![Creating a New Storage Account](Images/newStorageOne.png?raw=true "Creating a New Storage Account")

	_Creating a New Storage Account_

1.  Click "Create Storage Account".

1.  After your storage account is created, click manage keys at the bottom.

	![Manage Storage Keys](Images/storageManageKeys.png?raw=true "Manage Storage Keys")

	_Manage Storage Keys_

1.  Make note of the primary access key.  This along with the name of the storage account will be used later.

### Adding Depedent Libraries and Uploading an existing PHP Website into the Windows Azure Web Site using GIT ###

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Before we can push our site up to Windows Azure, we need to pull down a couple third party libraries.  This PHP site was built using Silex which is a micro-PHP framework.  Silex allows the site to easily set up web service end points.  Let's go get that library now.

1.  Open a browser and go to http://silex.sensiolabs.org/

1.  Click the download link.

1.  Go to the bottom of the page and download the PHAR file.

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Now let's get our PHP site ready to push to Windows Azure Websites.
>
> Lets go to the dashboard panel of the Web Site we have just created.

1. Back to the Windows Azure Management Portal, click your Web Site name, under the **Name** column to access the Dashboard.

	![Accessing the Web Site Dashboard](Images/goToDashboard.png?raw=true "Accessing the Web Site Dashboard")

	> **Speaking Point**
	>
	>  We can see at the Dashboard, a set of useful information about the Web Site. Such as access reports, hardware usage and database access.
	>
	> We also can find here multiple options to upload content to the Web Sites. We can do it using GIT, TFS or FTP.

	> **Speaking Point**
	>
	> To access the Web Site with an GIT, we need to specify the deployment credentials we will be using.
